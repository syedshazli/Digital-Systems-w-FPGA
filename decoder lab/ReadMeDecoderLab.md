This lab aims to give us an introduction to FPGA's. We essentiallly build a bit decoder, which lights up LED's based on turning on certain switches up to 3 bits.

So turning on switches 0 to 2 would be 111 in binary, which corresponds to 7. So we expect the 7th LED to light up  As a result, this lights up LED 6, due to 0 indexing.
